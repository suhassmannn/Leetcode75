Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

-> strings can be converted to a list of words using the .split() function.
-> a list of words can be joined using the "<separator>".join() function.
-> a whole list can be reversed using the .reverse() function. (this function is applicable only to lists)
